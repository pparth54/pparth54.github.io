The DOC operates facilities and court commands across the five boroughs with more than 11,000 diverse professionals and knowledge experts.  What We Do:  The Investigation and Trials Division is essential to DOCâs efforts to ensure the integrity, professionalism, and accountability of all members of service. The Investigation Division is responsible for investigating acts of misconduct allegedly committed by agency personnel such as: excessive use of force, undue familiarity with detainees, firearms regulation violations, erroneous discharges, escapes, improper outside employment, and any other on or off-duty conduct unbecoming a member of the Department, or of a nature that brings discredit upon the agency. In addition, the Investigation Division is charged with investigating allegations of sexual assault committed by staff and/or detainees.   The Trials Division employs attorneys, paralegals and support staff who prosecute substantiated acts of misconduct at the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.  The Investigation and Trials Division often liaises with external investigative and prosecutorial agencies such as the Department of Investigation, District Attorneyâs Offices, and the New York City Police Department in the course of investigating and prosecuting criminal acts.  Why DOC: The Investigation and Trials Division is seeking to hire qualified candidates who are eager to apply and enhance their knowledge of the criminal justice system.  The Division is staffed by both uniform and non-uniform investigators, a unique structure that inspires an unbiased and informed atmosphere and a culture of respect.  Because the Investigation and Trials Divisions are combined, DOC investigators regularly learn from and assist our seasoned trial attorneys in the pursuit of fair and meaningful discipline.

Line plot was also a good option but bar chart looked better and easy to read. 
I have also used an aggregate function sum to calculate the total number of positions.
For the X-axis I have used Nominal for Categorical data and for the y-axis I used quantitative scale for numerical field Number of positions.</p><h2 id="line-plot-from-the-new-york-city-job-listings-dataset">Line Plot from the New York City Job listings Dataset</h2><h2 id="select-from-the-dropdown--">Select from the dropdown -</h2><ol><li>If you want to display the average Salary range for different Agency, select Agency.</li><li>If you want to display the average Salary range for different career levels, Career Level.</li><li>If you want to display the average Salary range for different desgination levels, Level.</li></ol><h2 id="select-your-field-to-plot-on-the-x-axis">Select your field to plot on the x-axis</h2><select options="Agency,Career Level,Level"><option selected="" value="Agency">Agency</option><option value="Career Level">Career Level</option><option value="Level">Level</option></select><div></div><ul><li>The red line represents the lower value of the salary range.</li><li>The blue line represents the upper value of the salary range.</li></ul><p>
For the second plot, I have created two layers:</p><ol><li>Red line plot for showing Lower limit of salary</li><li>Blue line plot for showing the upper limit of salary.</li></ol><p>
I tried the bar plot as well as scatter plot. The scatter plot didnt distinguish the two layers and it was kind of hard to tell the range by just looking at the plot.
The same was the case with bar plot. Hence I went with the line plot.
The choice of scale was pretty straightforward. Again I used the aggregate mean function to calculate the mean of salaries. I used the Nominal scale for categorical variables and quantitative 
scale for the Salary field</p></div></div></div></div>
